# JavaScript Asynchrony Treehouse Blog Post Examples

There are the code examples to go along with my post on the Treehouse blog about concurrency in JavaScript. Before you do anything after downloading this project, be sure to run `npm install`. After that, you can run each of the 3 different variations with an `npm` script:

1. ## Callbacks
    - Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 6 or later installed
    - Run `npm run callbacks`
    - Point your favorite browser to [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000)

2. ## Promises
    - Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 6 or later installed
    - Run `npm run promises`
    - Point your favorite browser to [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000)

3. ## `async`/`await`
    - Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 7.6 or later installed
    - Run `npm run async-await`
    - Point your favorite browser to [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000)
